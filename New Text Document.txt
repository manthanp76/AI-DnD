Looking at the directory tree, the main structure is correct and well-organized. The only thing missing in terms of structure is content in the `assets/audio/effects` directory.

Here are the sound effects (.wav files) you need to add to `assets/audio/effects/`:

1. Combat-related:
- sword_hit.wav
- sword_miss.wav
- critical_hit.wav
- monster_hit.wav
- monster_die.wav
- player_hit.wav
- player_hit_critical.wav
- player_die.wav
- shield_block.wav
- combat_start.wav
- retreat_success.wav
- retreat_fail.wav

2. Item interaction:
- item_pickup.wav
- item_use.wav
- potion_use.wav
- equip_weapon.wav
- equip_armor.wav
- item_discover.wav

3. Movement and exploration:
- footsteps.wav
- examine.wav
- search.wav
- dialog.wav

4. UI sounds:
- menu_open.wav
- action_generic.wav
- level_up.wav

You can find these types of sound effects from sources like:
- OpenGameArt.org
- FreeSoundEffects.com
- FreeSound.org

Make sure the sound files are:
- In .wav format
- Named exactly as listed above
- Placed in the `assets/audio/effects` directory

The directory structure itself is complete and correctly organized - you just need to add these sound effect files to have the full audio experience working.
